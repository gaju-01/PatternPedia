## Patternpedia
This repository is a comprehensive collection of real-world examples demonstrating the practical applications of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS), Object-Oriented Design (OOD), and Low-Level Design (LLD) principles and patterns. It aims to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and their implementation in real-life development scenarios.

## Note
The code and the designs might differ based upon the application, use case and user prespective. The code in this github repo only includes the simpler design of the LLD problems. Please feel free to fork the repo and refactor based upon the requirement as this is not the final code. Below are some of the resources attached to standard LLS problems and design patterns.
